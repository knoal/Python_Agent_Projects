# Pyython_Agent_Projects
Agentic ideas for LLMs.
Fun ideas to lean about agentic programming in Python.
All code was Generated by querying an LLM (OpenAI, Cluade, Grok and then importing the code into Pycharm.
The output errors from PyCharm are then fed back into the LLM for code update, then the code is then copy/pasted back into PyCharm.  Lots of iteration.
Have fun.  Good luck.

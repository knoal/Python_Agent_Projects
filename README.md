# Python_Agent_Projects
Agentic ideas for LLMs.
Fun ideas to lean about agentic programming in Python.
The programs you will need, download:
  Python 3.12
  Pycharm --community edition (Cursor AI is recommended, but I haven;t got it working yet)
  CrewAI  --creates the AI agents, who do you bidding.

All code was Generated by querying an LLM (OpenAI, Cluade, Grok and then importing the code into Pycharm.
The output errors from PyCharm are then fed back into the LLM for code update, then the code is then copy/pasted back into PyCharm.  Lots of iteration.
Have fun.  Good luck.

Project ideas:
AI Agent with RAG ability (user adds files and the LLM can incorporate the file data into your projec.  CrewAI agent tools)
AI Agent conversation bot (podcast style iwth user given topic, user selected time length)
Voice interaction with computer and AI agent
Personal AI agent:  Canledar, voice, scheduler, reminder (voice message at alert time), set a timeer, send a text

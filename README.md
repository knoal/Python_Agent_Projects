Agentic ideas for LLM
Fun ideas to lean about agentic programming in Python.
All code was Generated by querying an LLM (OpenAI, Cluade, Grok and then importing the code into Pycharm.
The output errors from PyCharm are then fed back into the LLM to update the code, then the code is then copy/pasback ted into PyCharm.  Lots of iteration.
Have fun.  Good luck.
